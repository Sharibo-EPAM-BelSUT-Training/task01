# task01
First task in **[EPAM BelSUT Training](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training).**

I used classes, interfaces, fields, methods, enumeration. I also learned how to work with collections and arrays. I created documentation comments and generated a [javadoc](https://sharibo-epam-belsut-training.github.io/task01/). In the end I built a [jar-file](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task01/releases).
